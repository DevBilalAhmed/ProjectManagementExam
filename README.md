## Thoughts
The Exam uses a mock case, to see how we respond to the tasks based on theory. I believe there is some merit to theory, but alot of these answers are usually dependent on human factors. Truly understanding the scope of a project before you start working on it, is what i believe is important. Following up with questions after initially getting a project and through the project for continues feedback to avoid confusion or refactoring, and making sure to make good documentation for each and every aspect of the project. 

## Where to improve

Based on my own text, in hindsight i believe i should have been more thorough on some of the tasks.

This is again theory only, but i wish i went into more detail about the end-user feedback being a crucial part for both software, but also the design through each itereation of the project.

I also believe the text lacked on the risk analysis for a software project, it should have mentioned more risks. From later experience i am well aware that there are plenty more risks to account for both for developing the project, and in concern for the end-user. I should also have mentioned more then one approach to some of the risks, "The end-user not liking the application" can have many ways to deal with that risk other then just researching through development.
